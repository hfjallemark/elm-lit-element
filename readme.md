# Elm ❤️ Web Components

_Disclaimer_: I am pretty new to Elm so any ideas exploring here should not be too seriously -- these are merely thought experiments on how I prefer to build front ends, and my experience with React and TypeScript (and inexperience with Elm) may well be clouding my judgement on how to [really do stuff](https://guide.elm-lang.org/reuse/) [in Elm](https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/6x5w07/components_in_elm_why_not_and_how/).

I published a blog post around the ideas I am exploring here: [Separating Your Front-End Concerns with Web Components](https://dev.to/hfjallemark/separating-your-front-end-concerns-with-web-components--4p85).
